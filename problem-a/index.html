        The character, <a href="https://beemovie.fandom.com/wiki/Barry_B._Benson">Barry B. Benson</a>,is from the 
        award winning animated film, the 'Bee Movie'. The film, produced by Dreamworks Animation, came out in 2007 
        and quickly left fans with a love and appreciation for its characters and messages. The plot of the film 
        surrounds Barry B. Benson, as he navigates his post-grad experience and searches within himself through his 
        existential crisis. He breaks the rule to never communicate with humans, but discovers through his rebellion 
        the real mistreatment of his species. He dedicates his mission in life to obtain justice for his kind by suing 
        humanity!
